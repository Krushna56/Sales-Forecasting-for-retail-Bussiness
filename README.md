- Regression techniques  
- Trend and seasonality analysis  

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries  
- **Python**  
- **Prophet** – forecasting library  
- **Scikit-learn** – regression & ML models  
- **Pandas** – data manipulation & cleaning  
- **Matplotlib** – data visualization  

## 📂 Dataset  
- **Source**: [Sales data](#) *(replace with link if public)*  
- **Format**: Daily, weekly, or monthly sales numbers  
- **Content**: Historical sales figures used for forecasting future demand  

## 🎯 Deliverable  
- A **forecasting model** that predicts future sales trends
